# Watcher

Monitor your AI coding agents from the menu bar.

## Features

- See all active Claude Code sessions
- Get notified on permission requests
- Track what Claude is doing in real-time

## Getting Started

```bash
git pull
cd agentstatus
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

macOS only. Requires [Claude Code](https://claude.ai/code).

## How It Works

Watcher monitors Claude Code sessions running on your machine and displays their status in your menu bar. When Claude requests permissions, you'll get a notification so you can respond quickly.
